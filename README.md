## Overview
Chromium-based extension to temporarily block access to a list of websites.

When blocking is enabled, any of the desired websites will display an error every time access is attempted.

You can also set a PIN to access the extension and disable the lock.

It is possible to block only subdomains or subdirectories, instead of an entire website.
See some examples in the extension itself.
